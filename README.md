# News Headlines Project

## Problem Domain Description

The News Headlines project aims to provide users with access to current news headlines from various news sources. Users can specify their interests, such as technology, sports, entertainment, etc., and retrieve the latest news articles.

## High-Level Description

The News Headlines application is a command-line tool that leverages the News API to fetch and display current news headlines based on user preferences. Users can input their preferred news category, and the application sends an API request to retrieve and display the latest news articles from trusted sources.

## API Documentation

We will use the News API, which provides a simple and easy-to-use interface to access news articles. You can find the API documentation here: [News API Documentation](https://newsapi.org/docs)
